## Description

This is a mono-repository for everything that relates to the design of the **monocircuit** organization. That is, designs like logos or banners, but also particular website components.

## Content

The repository is currently split into two main directories `/graphics` and `/svelte`

### `/graphics`

The `/graphics` directory contains various digital art designs, especially those that are non-responsive. It also might be renamed soon.

### `/svelte`

This folder holds everything related to svelte. That is mostly reponsive web components.
