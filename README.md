# Design

## Description

This is a mono-repository for everything that relates to the design of the **monocircuit** organization. That is, designs like logos or banners, but also particular website components.

## Content

The repository is currently split into two main directories `/static` and `/dynamic`

### `/static`

This directory contains static imagery like logos or just the general branding of products and the organization itself.

### `/dynamic`

Here things like frontend framework components can be found. Although it is questioned, if there will be a consistent style throughout all webpages.
